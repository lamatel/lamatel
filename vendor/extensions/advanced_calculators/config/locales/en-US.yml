  bucket_list_information: "
     In order to use the Bucket Rate calculator, you need to create intervals without gaps between them. 
     <br />When the order total does not fall within an interval, the default rate will be used.
     Order amounts larger than the largest ceiling will use the last interval rate.
     <br />NOTE: The FLOOR value is inclusive and the CEILING value is exclusive.
